# Project Title

Concept Lattice for a Formal Concept Analysis(FCA)

---

## ðŸ“˜ Description

In Formal Concept Analysis concept lattice is used as a better way of representing a d
ata in a graphical way, and it has a lot of applcations in machine learing, Data Mining, and others.

- What this code does is that it takes a context or a data set in format like the one below in csv file, 
and returns a graph that represents the dataset in a more compact and readble form.

## ðŸ§¾ Example

- Context (Dataset)

,A,B,C,D,E,F
0,1,0,0,0,1,1
1,1,0,0,1,0,1
2,0,1,0,0,1,1
3,0,1,0,1,0,1
4,0,1,1,0,0,0
